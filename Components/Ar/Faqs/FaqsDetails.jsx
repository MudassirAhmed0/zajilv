Very often such large-volume modes require smaller transport fleet to cover the “lastmile,” a term describing the distance between a warehouse or distribution center and the final destination such as a home or office. It is usually much more than a mile. Door-to-door service is offered to take responsibility for the entire shipping route, from the point of origin (where the shipment or package is to be picked up) to the destination, the final delivery point. Door-to-door service is typical of small packages such as overnight express packages. Some businesses have very complex supply chains with multiple shipping carrier involvement. For these customers Zajil is the single-point of contact responsible for managing every stage ofthe pick-up and delivery process.",
